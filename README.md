This portfolio showcases a collection of blockchain projects I developed while completing an intensive blockchain bootcamp. Through these projects, I've gained expertise in building smart contracts, dApps, and exploring the Solana ecosystem. This repository serves as a demonstration of my skills, passion, and commitment to mastering blockchain development.

üî• What I've Built
These projects cover a wide range of blockchain applications, from simple smart contracts to full-scale dApps, using technologies like Solana, Rust, and Anchor.

Key Projects:
Voting dApp - A decentralized application where users can create polls and cast votes, ensuring transparency and immutability on the Solana blockchain.

Token Swap - A DeFi protocol that allows users to swap tokens seamlessly with low transaction fees, built with the Solana Program Library (SPL).

NFT Marketplace - A platform for minting, buying, and selling NFTs, integrating Rust and the Metaplex Candy Machine for a smooth user experience.
Token Vesting Platform - A smart contract that automates token distribution schedules, providing secure and time-bound releases.
